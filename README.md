# Pixel Power Monitoring and Analysis Tool

This project aims to develop a power monitoring and analysis tool for the Pixel device. It provides real-time monitoring of power consumption metrics such as CPU usage, battery level, screen brightness, and network activity.

## Project Overview

The Pixel Power Monitoring and Analysis Tool project consists of the following completed tasks:

1. Set up the project structure and dependencies.
2. Designed the user interface with the main activity layout.
3. Implemented the XML layout for the main activity, including TextView and Button elements.
4. Added necessary code to collect power consumption data in real-time using the BatteryManager API.
5. Updated the TextView dynamically with the power consumption readings.
6. Added a button to trigger the update of power consumption readings.
7. Integrated the project with version control using Git and created a repository on GitHub.
8. Pushed the initial project code and subsequent updates to the GitHub repository for version control.
